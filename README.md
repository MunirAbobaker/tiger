A significant gap has arisen between general Large Language Models (LLMs) and the vector stores that provide them with contextual information. Bridging this gap is a crucial step towards grounding AI systems in efficient and factual domains, where their value lies not only in their generality but also in their specificity and uniqueness.

In pursuit of this goal, we are thrilled to introduce the Tiger toolkit (TigerRag, TigerTune, and TigerDA) as an open-source resource for developers to create AI models tailored to their specific needs.

We believe that our efforts will play a pivotal role in shaping the next phase of language modeling. This phase involves organizations customizing AI systems to align with their unique intellectual property and perspectives, ushering in a new era of AI customization and precision.
