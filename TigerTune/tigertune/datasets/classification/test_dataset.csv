 Hi NoSeptember, 

 Per your comments on my RfA, I promise that I will keep flexibility a top priority in future while editing on Wikipedia. Hope to see positive interactions with you in the future. —   

  
 ==Footer== 
 I am pretty sure that there is a way for people with popups (or lupin's autoedit JS) to automatically move the footer to the bottom using regex. I might have to ask lupin for the syntax.  

 And, using that syntax, I could make it easy to auto-archive my talkpage at a click of a button (I already have the parserfunctions set to auto-list the archive if it exists). 

 I don't know why (or how) you edit the """"old fashion way"""", because it is not good for you and you might get a cold. Can you pleasssssseeeeeeeeee try non-old fashion out? just for once?

The School was sold in 1970 and continued to be run from the same address Bury Lawn, Union Street, Newport Pagnell until 1987 when it was moved to Milton Keynes where in 2010/2011 the name was changed to Webber Independent School.

 *I disagree with Ravpapa's post about """"power"""". This discussion isn't about """"power"""", though it can seem to devolve into that. It's really more a problem of WP naming policy being a Procrustean bed for specialties like ornithology or classical music, where a field of study has developed guidelines that best suit their specific needs, and then here at Wikipedia they get pushed and pulled to fit into schemes that are not just foreign to them, but by their lights simply don't work as well. That's how I see it anyway. But then I also have my own bete noir concerning encyclopedic tone as someone tried to describe it. I truly believe that if we are attempting to be authoritative we should also try to sound authoritative, and not """"dumb down"""" to the lowest common denominator of readers. Redirects do all the work, and the wording at the start of an article's lede assures immediate easy access to any and every wanted article. More properly formal article titles are noticed by most users, and do serve a valuable purpose in at least offering to a reader a concept of how the topic fits into a more general scheme, rather than reinforcing his/her limited view of the article in isolation.
